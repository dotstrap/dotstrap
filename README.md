# RecordIndexer
The Record Indexer project for CS 240 is a simplified version of the LDS Church’s online indexing system. The project consists of a “Server” and a “Client”. The Server is the back-end part of the system that keeps track of all of the record images that need to be indexed, downloads images to volunteers for indexing, stores the words found on each image in a database, and allows the images to be searched by key word. The Client is the part of the system that volunteers use to view the images, to type in the text they see on the images, and to send the captured text to the server for storage.
